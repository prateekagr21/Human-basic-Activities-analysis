# Activity Prediction of Humans by Using Machine Learning Algorithms !!
### _We, as a human do many things in our day today activities ! <br> and can say that we change activities in some period of time._

## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :

- Collected the data and organized to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and observed the data to form meaningful insights.
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..

### Did data Preprocessing...

## And then I made a Model for the Prediction :
- Scaled the data
- Dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space.
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split


## Fitted the Model by using :
- Using K-Neighbors Classifier.
- Plotted the confusion matrix.
- and Classification report.
- Plotted the Prediction.
